# Configuring the switchover agent

There are multiple environment variables set in the secret `sso-switchover-agent`.  Some of these variables are necessary for the app to trigger the switchover properly, others are only needed for notifications being sent out.

## Necessary varibles.

 - DOMAIN_NAME: The url the switchover agent monitors.  e.g. `dev.sandbox.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca`
 - GH_BRANCH: The branch in the sso-switchover-agent repo from which to deploy. `dev` for sandbox environments `main` for production.
 - GH_TOKEN: The personal access token for deploying the switchover actions.
 - NAMESPACE: The namespace in which we will we be deploying. In general, it is the same namespace as the switchover agent deployment.
 - PROJECT: The project (PRODUCTION, SANDBOX, OLD-SANDBOX), which we will be deploying.

## Delay failover

There is an optional delay feature on the switchover agent that prevents the agent from triggering if the GSLB briefly sends traffic away from gold for a few seconds.

`DELAY_SWITCHOVER_BY_SECS`

Is the time in seconds this delay will last.

## Rocket Chat Integration
To notify rocket chat when failover and failback occurs.  Create a rocket chat webhook (already done for SSO-keyacloak). Then add the following values to the secret file.  Currently the production alerts are client facing (sso), and the sandbox alerts are intertal (sso-ops channel).

 - RC_URL
 - RC_TOKEN
 - RC_URL_SSO_OPS
 - RC_TOKEN_SSO_OPS

 The `*_SSO_OPPS` environment variables are used to notify the team if the switchover agent detected a DNS change without triggering a failover.

## CSS App Integration

The CSS app should be put in maintenance mode when the production environent is down. Leave these blank for all agents except sandbox-dev and production-prod.

 - CSS_REPO: `sso-requests`
 - CSS_MAINTENANCE_WORKFLOW_ID: `deploy-gh-pages-maintenance.yml`
 - CSS_ENVIRONMENT: `dev` for sandbox dev, `prod` for production prod.
 - CSS_GH_TOKEN:  The personal access token for deploying the CSS app.
 - CSS_BRANCH: `dev` for sandbox-dev agent, `main` for production-prod agent.

## Uptime.com Status Page Integration

The switchover agent is able to create and close incidents on uptime status pages.  (Production is located at [https://status.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca/](https://status.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca/)).  To do this, two environment vars must be configured:

- UPTIME_STATUS_PAGE_ID: This integer can be found in the status page's non-vanity url for the status page hosted by uptime.com.
- UPTIME_STATUS_TOKEN: The credential used for the uptime.com API.  It can be found [here](https://uptime.com/api/tokens).
## Preemptive Failover

There are 4 optional environment variables if you need to schedule a failover/failback over night.  These are:
```
PREEMPTIVE_FAILOVER_START_TIME = "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM"
PREEMPTIVE_FAILOVER_END_TIME = "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM"
PREEMPTIVE_WORKFLOW_ID = "preemptive-failover.yml
ENABLE_GOLD_ROUTE_WORKFLOW_ID = "turn-off-gold-routing.yml"
```

The time zone is hardcoded to "American/Vancouver".  If you add a couple of valid times to the `PREEMPTIVE_FAILOVER_START_TIME` and `PREEMPTIVE_FAILOVER_END_TIME` and restart the switchover agent, the logs will show the following text:

```
clients.preemptive_count_down A PREEMPTIVE FAILOVER TO GOLDDR IS SCHEDULED AT 2024-03-12 08:38:00-07:00
clients.preemptive_count_down TRAFFIC WILL BE RETURNED TO GOLD AT: 2024-03-12 08:41:00-07:00
```

Then every minute a log will be output describing the state of the failover counter. There are 4 possible messages depending on the countdowns state.

```
[INFO ] clients.preemptive_count_down The preemptive failover will occur in 0:01:53 hh:mm:ss.
[DEBUG] logic                The preemptive failover to GoldDR is triggered
[INFO ] clients.preemptive_count_down Traffic returns to gold in: 0:01:53 hh:mm:ss.
[DEBUG] logic                The Gold route is being re-enabled
```

Pairing this with a couple of DNS checking Uptime alerts will give the team the confidence to schedule a preemptive failover for the loginproxy app.

## CHES log integration

To persist the events the switchover agent records, we have integrated it with the CHES email server.  There are four environment varibles that must be set for this to work:

```
CHES_TOKEN_ENDPOINT
CHES_USERNAME
CHES_PASSWORD
LOG_EMAIL
```

The credentials are stored with the team secrets and the `LOG_EMAIL` is a comma separated list for the accounts we want these logs sent to.
