# The SSL Cert renewal process.

## Steps
 - Create the iStore Request for a new cert
 - Generate the cert singing request in the `./env/<<namepace>>/` folder.
 - Create the Openshift Secret from those values in Gold and GoldDR
 - Run the bash script `update_ssl_cert.sh` to upgrade the certs.

## Create the iStore Request for a new cert

You will need to complete the request form: https://ssbc-client.gov.bc.ca/services/isr_forms/hosting_ssl_site_reverse.docx

The form is submitted through the iStore by attaching it to a new ticket. https://imbsd.gov.bc.ca/.  You will need to be connected to the VPN to access this site.

## Generate the cert singing request in the `./env/<<namepace>>/` folder.

<!--  TODO CONVERT THIS CREATION TO A BASH SCRIPT -->
There will be five secrets uploaded to the namespace:

```
L1K-for-certs.txt
L1K-root-for-certs-G2.txt
loginproxy.csr
loginproxy.key
loginproxy.txt
```

They can be stored locally in the untracked folders `./env/<<namepace>>/`.  Once the secret is generated, it can be used by the `update_route_credentials.sh` script to update the Route objects.

In certain cases a single cert is used for multiple environments.  In that case a copy of the secrets must be saved in each environment's namespace folder.

## Create an openshift secret with these new values

The make ssl secret script will create the secrets

Log into the Gold cluster and run the `sso-switchover-agent/transition-scripts/update_route_credentials.sh` script.

`./make_ssl_secret.sh <<NAMESPACE>> <<YEAR>>`

Log into the GoldDR cluster and repeat.

`./make_ssl_secret.sh <<NAMESPACE>> <<YEAR>>`

This script will create a secret with name `loginproxy-ssl-cert-secret.<<year>>`.  It will error out if that secret with that name already exists.

## Run the script to update the cert values

<!-- TODO: do we want to do the gold change first so that we have a GoldDR safety net?-->
### GoldDR
In GoldDR, run:

`./update_route_credentials.sh <<namespace>> golddr year`

The previous script may cert change may not take place imediately.  Check that the cert expiry date has updated by running the folowing script:

`./check_endpoint_health.sh <<namespace>> golddr`

The last line of output will be the date the certificate expires on.  It should be approximately 1 year in the future.

### Gold

Once the GoldDR route is confimed up and healthy

`./update_route_credentials.sh <<namespace>> gold year`

Check that the Gold cert change worked by navigating to the browser. Or by running:

`./check_endpoint_health.sh <<namespace>> gold`
